This is a very very early version of the Drone ghost trap from Ghostbusters Frozen Empire.

Currently it is too heavy for the sub 250g drone/licence. Mostly I made this to display a drone trap prop.

All the output 3d models are created by me. I am a novice to building in 3D, I mostly make to learn skills.
